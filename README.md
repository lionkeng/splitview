This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# SplitView

This experimental UI is a container which has 2 children containers and the width of the children containers can be dynamically adjusted using a knob.

The inspiration for this experiment comes from [Twenty Twenty](https://zurb.com/playground/twentytwenty).
